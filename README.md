# Purpose
This toolkit is designed to analyse the underlying representation of a image classification network.  

# Instructions

Create folder with data:  
raw_outputs.npz  
encoded:outputs.npz  
attributions.csv  -> must contrain column with filepaths

# Outputs

Generates outputs for representative images based on a k-means clustering of the latent space. Latennt space dimenstions are reduced to 50 by pca and 3 by T-SNE.   
Generates the most overconfident as well as underconfident images based on the softmax response (could be adjusted to other confidence score).
The app.py file can be run by "python3 app.py" and starts an interactive dash app that allows the user to explore the latent space of his neural network and the images linked to each data point. The data necessary to run the app can be generated by the package. After initalizing the main analyser simply run analyzer.prepaire_dash() and the correct data frame is written.
